Adium Campfire
==============

AdiumCampfire adds support for [37signals' Campfire](http://campfirenow.com/) to [Adium](http://adium.im/) instant messaging application.

This is a pre-beta version of software that should be treated like a working prototype. There is no support for files and transcripts and the plugin is still leaking memory. As it shouldn't be used by normal people, the only way to get a working plugin, is to compile it oneself from the code in the repository.

Installation
------------
1. Checkout the [AdiumCampfire repository](https://github.com/zuber/AdiumCampfire) to a local directory.
2. Checkout the [Adium 1.4 repository](http://trac.adium.im/wiki/GettingNewestAdiumSource) to a local directory.
3. Open the project in XCode, go to project build settings and change the `ADIUM` variable to point to the directory containing a checkout of Adium 1.4 source code.
4. Build the project.
5. Double-click on `build/Debug/AdiumCampfire.AdiumPlugin` to install it.

Usage
-----
1. Change the Campfire domain in the source code (Yes! There is no other way to change the domain currently).
2. Start Adium.
3. Navigate to `File->Add Account` in the menu and choose `Campfire` in the dropdown list.
4. Put your Campfire username as username and your [API authentication token](https://setjam.campfirenow.com/member/edit) as password.
5. All the Campfire rooms in the domain should be now available under the *Campfire* group.
